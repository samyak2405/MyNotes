## Payment Security
- Digital Payment Transactions are increasing day by day because of Cashless payments, Reduced time and Reduced transaction cost.
- Due to this fraudulent activities like Hacking, Security treats, Identity theft, Disputed transactions and Cybercrimes are also increasing.
- Hence Digital payment security is essential to protect the customer data and transaction data with ultimate privacy.
- In order to ensure payment security, Merchants integrate their businesses with payment gateways as a safer and reliable option.

- Establishing trust at every phase of payment lifecycle is important.
- Regularize digital payment methods with common standards to enable secure hassle-free and frictionless transactions.
- The Euro, Mastercard and Visa in early 90's established the 3 Domain security(3DS) for traditional browser-based e-commerce transactions.
  
![3DS Explaination](./PaymentSecurity1.jpg)

- Based on the 3 Domain Security, security of physical card, cardholder and merchant are ensured.
- All these 3 domains have to support and accept the end-to-end 3 Domain Security protocols as they cannot operate without adhering to the 3DS standards.

![Physical Card Security](./PhysicalCardSecurity.jpg)

2. Card holder Security(Identity)
![Card holder Security](./CardHolderSecurity.jpg)

3. Merchant(Authenticity)
![Merchant security](./MerchantSecurity.jpg)

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
**Authentication**
- The physical card security and cardholder security establishes authentication as it verifies the card details(name, card number,CVV, etc). 
- The Features or knowledge of the cardholder allows access and usage of the card using biometrics, PIN, OTP or other behavioural patterns.

**Authorization**
- If the transaction passes through the merchant security and 3DS, it establishes authorization to the bank to verify what the user has access to (card, balance, card validity, card blocked status, etc).
- If the bank provides the authorization, the payment transaction is completed.

**3DS 2.0**

   - Track device fingerprinting
   - Track behavioral biometrics including password patterns, typing speed etc.
3. Enterprise screening(Carried out to identify fraud patterns)
   - Validating multiple merchant touch points
   - Correlating several use cases in search for potential relationships, link analysisand linkage to the customers(in terms of addresses, devices, time etc)
4. Case management(Identifies the potential suspect transactions)
   - High level investigations
   - Simple and effective user interface
   - Automated case management using IVR systems

2. The payment switch from the acquirer will take this $100 and pass it to the payment network Visa. The acquirer submits a $100 authorization to Visa.
3. Visa submits a $100 authorization to the issuer
4. The issuer will validate if the cardholder has enough balance in their account.
5. They will respond.
6. After checking the buyer's ability to pay the $100, the issuer returns a response for a $100 authorization to Visa.
