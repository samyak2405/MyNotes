1. Domain Name Server(DNS)
	- hierarchical and distributed system used to translate human-readable domain names(www.example.com)
	  into IP addresses like 192.168.1.1
	- IP addresses are used to identify each other on the internet or a private n/w.
2. Load Balancer
	- N/w device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers or services to
	  improve the performance and availability of the system.
	- sits between the client and server and uses various algorithms to distribute incoming requests among
	  the available servers in a manner that maximizes performance and ensures that no single server is 
	  overwhelmed.
3. API Gateway
	- Server that acts as a single point of entry for a set of microservices.
	- Receives client requests, forwards them to the appropriate microservice, and returns server's response to 
	  the client.
	- Responsible for tasks such as routing, authentication and rate limiting.
4. CDN
	- A distributed n/w of servers that are deployed in multiple locations around the world.
	- These servers are designed to deliver web content such as images, videos and other static files to users based on their 
	  geographical location.
	- Main purpose is to improve the performance and availability of web content by caching it on servers that are closer to the users
	  who are requesting it.
5. Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
	- Forward Proxy: Server that sits in front of one or more client m/cs and acts as an intermediary between the clients and the internet.
					 When client request for a resource on internet the request first goes to the forward proxy.
					 Forward proxy then forwards the request to the internet on behalf of the client m/c and returns response to the client m/c.
	- Reverse Proxy: Server that sits in front of one or more web servers and acts as an intermediary between the web servers and the Internet.
					 When a client makes a request to a resource on the internet, the request is first sent to the reverse proxy.
					 Reverse proxy then forwards the request to one of the web servers, which returns the response to the reverse proxy.
					 Reverse proxy then returns the response to the client.
6. Caching
	- High speed storage layer
	- sits between the application and the original source of the data such as DB, File system or remote web service.
	- If data is requested
		If found in Cache
			return data to the application
		else
			retrieve from its original source
			store it in cache 
			return data to the application
	- Caching can be done at multiple places 
		1. Client Cache
			- Use case: Faster retrieval of content
			- Solutions: Browser cache
		2. DNS Cache
			- Use case: Faster domain to IP resolution
			- Solutions: Amazon Rout 53, Azure DNS, Google Cloud DNS
		3. CDN Cache
			- Use case: Faster retrieval of static content
			- Solutions: Akamai, CloudFront, ElastiCache, Azure CDN
		4. Web Server Cache
			- Use case: Faster retrieval of web content.
			- Solutions: CloudFront, ElastiCache
		5. App Server Cache
			- Use case: Accelerated application performance and data access
			- Solutions: Local server cache, remote cache on redis, memcached, ElastiCache
		6. Database cache
			- Use case: Faster access to data stored
			- Solutions: Local DB cache, Remote cache on Redis, Memcached, ElastiCache, etc.
7. Data Partitioning
	Horizontal Partitioning:(Sharding) Dividing rows of a table into smaller tables and storing them on different
							servers or database instances.
							- distributes the load of a database across multiple servers and to improve performance.
	Vertical Partitioning: Dividing the columns of a table into separate tables.
						   Reduces the number of columns in a table and to improve the performance of queries that only access a small
						   number of columns.
8. Sharding
	- Technique used to scale a database by horizontal partitioning
	- distribute the data and workload across multiple servers, so that each server can handle a smaller portion of the overall data and workload.
	- Improve performance and scalability of DB as each server can process queries and updates more efficiently when it is working with smaller amount of data.
	- Range-based sharding
		- Data is partitioned based on a key value, such as a userID or a timestamp
