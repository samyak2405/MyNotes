## Credit Card

- A CIBIL Score is a consumer's credit score. Simply put, this is a three-digit numeric summary of a consumer's credit history and a reflection of the person's credit profile. This is based on past credit behavior, such as borrowing and repayment habits as shared by banks and lenders with CIBIL on a regular basis (the details of which are featured in the consumer's CIBIL Report).
- A CIBIL Report is a consolidated credit report that includes the consumer's CIBIL Score and credit summary, personal information, contact information, employment information, and loan account information. It is important to note that lenders consider both the CIBIL Score and Report to assess a person's loan eligibility.

## Types of Interest
1. Simple Interest
   - Calculated on initial principal amount
   - Formula: Interest amount = Principal amount * interest rate * time the money is borrowed or invested for(usually in years)

2. Compound Interest
   - Takes into account the interest earned on both the initial principal amount and any interest that has already been earned
   - Exponential growth in your savings or debt
   - Formula: A = P(1+r/n)^(n*t)
   - A -> Future amount
   - P -> Principal amount
   - r -> Annual interest rate
   - n -> Number of times that interest is compounded per year
   - t -> Number of years the money is invested or borrowed for
   - r/n -> Periodic Interest rate (Interest rate applied during each compounding period)
   - Eg: Interest rate = 5% annually and is compounded quaterly 4times a year, then r = 0.05 and n = 4 and Periodic interest rate -> 0.05/4 = 0.0125(1.25%)
