PTR
	1. Now we usually annotate Repository interface with @Repository annotation, right But we don't have to add 
	   @Repository annotation over here because we have a SimpleJpaRepository class spring data JPA module
	   provides SimpleJpaRepository Class, which implements JpaRepository interface and SimpleJpaRepository
	   class internally internnaly annotated with @Repository annotation That's why we don't have to again 
	   add our interface with @Repository annotation.
	
	2. Spring Boot provides the @DataJpaTest annotation to test the persistence layer components that will autoconfigure
	   in-memory embedded database for testing purposes.
	   
	3.  Template to write a JUnit Test
		
			@Test
			public void given_when_then(){
				//given - precondition or setup
				
				//when - action or the behavior that we are going to test
				
				//then - verify the output
			}
